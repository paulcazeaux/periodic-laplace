/** \ingroup laplace_3d_periodic
 *  \brief Construct a "synthetic" representation of the double-layer boundary
 *  operator associated with the Laplace equation in a periodic box in 3D.
 *
 *  This function creates a double-layer Laplace boundary operator \f$\mathcal
 *  A\f$ whose weak form is stored as the product
 *
 *  \f[
 *     A = P A_{\textrm{d}} Q,
 *  \f]
 *
 *  where \f$A_{\textrm{d}}\f$ is the weak form of \f$\mathcal A\f$ discretised
 *  with the <em>discontinuous</em> test and trial function spaces passed in the
 *  parameters \p internalTestSpace and \p internalTrialSpace, \f$Q\f$ is the
 *  sparse matrix mapping the degrees of freedom of \p domain to those of \p
 *  internalTrialSpace, and \f$P\f$ the matrix mapping the degrees of freedom of
 *  \p internalTestSpace to \p dualToRange.
 *
 *  If <tt>internalTrialSpace == domain</tt> or <tt>internalTestSpace ==
 *  dualToRange</tt>, \f$P\f$ or \f$Q\f$ becomes an identity matrix and is
 *  not physically created.
 *
 *  In ACA mode, synthetic operators are, as a rule, built more quickly than
 *  "standard" operators (ACA is faster for operators discretised with
 *  discontinuous spaces), but use up more memory and their matrix-vector
 *  product may be more time-consuming.
 *
 *  See the documentation of SyntheticIntegralOperator for more information
 *  about the concept of synthetic operators.
 *
 *  \param[in] context
 *    A Context object that will be used to build the weak form of the
 *    boundary operator when necessary.
 *  \param[in] domain
 *    Function space being the domain of the boundary operator.
 *  \param[in] range
 *    Function space being the range of the boundary operator.
 *  \param[in] dualToRange
 *    Function space dual to the the range of the boundary operator.
 *  \param[in] internalTrialSpace
 *    Trial function space used in the discretisation of \f$\mathcal A\f$ to
 *    \f$A_{\textrm{d}}\f$. It must be a discontinuous space, with basis
 *    functions extending over single elements only.
 *  \param[in] internalTestSpace
 *    Test function space used in the discretisation of \f$\mathcal A\f$ to
 *    \f$A_{\textrm{d}}\f$. It must be a discontinuous space, with basis
 *    functions extending over single elements only.
 *  \param[in] label
 *    Textual label of the operator. If empty, a unique label is generated
 *    automatically.
 *  \param[in] symmetry
 *    Symmetry of the weak form of the operator. Can be any combination of the
 *    flags defined in the enumeration type Symmetry.
 *
 *  None of the shared pointers may be null. \p internalTestSpace must be
 *  defined on the same grid as \p range and \p dualToRange, while \p
 *  internalTrialSpace must be defined on the same grid as \p domain; otherwise
 *  an exception is thrown.
